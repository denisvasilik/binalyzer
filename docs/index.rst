Binalyzer
=========

Welcome to Binalyzer's documentation. Binalyzer is a library that eases
binary data handling. It uses the approach of describing a data format using
a template. Binding the template to binary data, Binalyzer enables read access,
write access or modification of it. No need to manually write a parser or seek
through byte streams anymore.

Get started with :ref:`installation` and then get an overview with the
:ref:`quickstart`. Templates are described in the :ref:`template` section. A
full reference is described in the :ref:`api` section.

Binalyzer depends on the `Antlr`_ runtime. The documentation for this library
can be found at:

- `Antlr documentation <https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/index.md>`_
