# Binalyzer

Binalyzer is a library that eases binary data handling. It uses the approach of
describing a data format using a template. Binding the template to binary data,
Binalyzer enables read access, write access or modification of it. No need to
manually write a parser or seek through byte streams anymore.

Binalyzer supports the following use cases:

* Binary data handling for analysis or modification
* Binary data generation
* Binary data transformation
